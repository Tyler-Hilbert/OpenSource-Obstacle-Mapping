Obstacle mapping is a huge issue in autonomous navigation. This includes autonomous cars, autonomous sidewalk robots, autonomous cleaning robots, autonomous delivery robots and pretty much every other mobility robotics project.  
OSOM solves obstacle mapping by creating one universal platform for all obstacle data to be entered into.
