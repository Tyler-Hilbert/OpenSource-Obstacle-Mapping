Obstacle mapping is a huge issue in autonomous navigation. The following industries have a burning need for obstacle mapping:  
* autonomous cars
* autonomous delivery robots
* autonomous mining robots
* autonomous drones
* autonomous construction robots
* autonomous sidewalk robots
* autonomous cleaning robots
* pretty much every other mobility robotics project  

OSOM solves obstacle mapping by creating one universal platform for all obstacle data to be entered into.
